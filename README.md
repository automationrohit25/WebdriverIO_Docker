# WebdriverIO_Docker

In this repository, I have created a framework for testing the web application using WebDriverIO.

Tech Stack used :
1. WebDriverIO
2. JavaScript 
3. Mocha Framework
4. Allure Reports
5. Docker

I have used the Mocha Framework for setting up this Automation Suite. Implemented the POM(Page Object Model) design pattern in the framework.
Cross browser testing(Chrome and Firefox)  has  been implemented.
For reporting purpose, I have used Allure Reports. and I have also setup the solution with the Docker Images.
